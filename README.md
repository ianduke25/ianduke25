### **About Me**
Thanks for visiting my GitHub! I direct Equalysis, a data science consulting firm blending traditional investigative approaches with contemporary data science methods to support equity-driven litigation. My work centers on exploring how academics, researchers, and activists can best analyze data and employ artificial intelligence in ways that civil rights lawyers, criminal defense investigators, and all those fighting for a more equal world can trust. 

**Academic Experience**

M.S. of Data Science @ University of San Francisco
B.A. of Government and Psychology @ Cornell University
  
**Social Impact and Research Interests**

As Founder and Data Scientist Equalysis, I currently support active litigation at the ACLU of Northern California, Covington LLC, and the Lawyer's Committee For Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area. I am especially passionate about bridging gaps in communication between 'data people' and attorneys — generating new tools and methodologies to bolster legal investigations.

### **Projects**
Take a look at a few public projects I'm most proud of:

◆ **Body Camera Search Classifier(https://github.com/ianduke25/bodycam_search_classifier)** – A linear machine learning model trained to classify transcripts of police-civilian interaction resulting in searches (88% test set accuracy, 83% test set recall).

◆ **Prison Operations Snapshot Application(https://github.com/ianduke25/prison_operations)** – An application scraping daily federal prison data and predicting future lockdown risk using a random forest model (93% test set accuracy).
