Thanks for visiting my GitHub! I direct Equalysis, a data science consulting company blending traditional investigative approaches with contemporary data science methods to support equity-driven litigation. My work centers on exploring how academics, researchers, and activists can best analyze data and employ artificial intelligence to bolster claims made in civil rights and criminal defense investigations.

## **Academic Experience**

◆ M.S. in Data Science @ University of San Francisco

◆ B.A. in Government and Psychology @ Cornell University
  
## **Social Impact and Research Interests**

I am particularly passionate about improving communication between data experts and attorneys. I use evolving data science techniques to automate investigative tasks, including analyzing body camera footage, connecting fragmented police records, and utilizing web scraping agents to monitor government activity in real time.

### **Projects**
Take a look at a few public projects I'm most proud of:

◆ **[Body Camera Search Classifier](https://github.com/ianduke25/bodycam_search_classifier)** – A linear machine learning model trained to classify transcripts of police-civilian interaction resulting in searches (**88% test set accuracy, 83% test set recall**).

◆ **[Prison Operations Snapshot Application](https://github.com/ianduke25/prison_operations)** – An application scraping daily federal prison data and predicting future lockdown risk using a random forest model (**93% test set accuracy**).
